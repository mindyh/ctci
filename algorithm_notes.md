# Graphs
#### Vocab
* Undirected
* Directed
* Strong connectivity
  * every node has a path to every other node
* DAG

#### Algorithms
* BFS - O(m+n), queue
* DFS - O(m+n), stack
* Check for Bipartiteness (every edge has one end in each side)
  * Cannot contain an odd cycle
  * build on top of BFS, mark each node 0 or 1 check if any 2 edges connect nodes of the same number
* Min-cut/Max-flow
* Shortest path
* Min spanning tree
